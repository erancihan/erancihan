# Input hook (CGEventTap / evdev / WH_MOUSE_LL)

- macOS: the CGEventTap freeze-hazard state machine is load-bearing. The tap must
  self-disable when Accessibility is revoked, on its own thread, with the bounded
  run-loop slice — a stopped watcher after grant once froze all input on the machine.
  Don't restructure it casually, and don't migrate the tap to `objc2-core-graphics`.
  The `NSWorkspace` read and the Accessibility-trust check/prompt are the parts that
  did move to the objc2 framework crates — see `platform/AGENTS.md` for the rule that
  every TCC call uses a typed binding rather than a hand-written `extern` block.
- The tap callback must never block and never panic: use `try_read`/`try_lock` only,
  queue bound actions off-thread, wrap the user callback in `catch_unwind`, and keep
  the stuck-callback watchdog that force-exits the agent if the budget is exceeded.
  An active HID-level tap serialises every pointer event; a hang freezes clicks
  machine-wide. Only suppress events from remappable Logitech sources
  (`source_is_remappable`) — never the built-in trackpad.
- A macOS tap stop request is not proof of teardown. Keep the independent lifecycle
  watchdog armed until the tap thread reports the tap destroyed (and, for an explicit
  stop, the thread exited). The watchdog must not call the Accessibility trust API —
  that query can stall during TCC revocation; monitor tap-thread progress instead, and
  force-exit the agent if revocation or shutdown stalls so macOS releases the HID tap.
- The off-main `frontmost_bundle_id` read keeps its explicit `autoreleasepool` — the
  watcher thread has no run loop; that is the only place in this crate a pool belongs.
- This crate ships non-macOS implementations (evdev/uinput, WH_MOUSE_LL) that a
  macOS-green build never compiles. CI lints them; treat the linux/windows CI jobs as
  the check, not local builds.
