//! on macOS, uinput/D-Bus on Linux, SendInput on Windows.

/// Synthesise the OS-level event for `action`.
///
/// On macOS, key events are posted via `CGEventPost(kCGHIDEventTap, …)`
/// using virtual key codes from the standard US keyboard layout, and the
/// `LeftClick`/`RightClick`/`MiddleClick` variants synthesise a mouse click
/// at the current cursor location. The WindowServer actions (`MissionControl`,
/// `AppExpose`, `ShowDesktop`, `LaunchpadShow`) are posted straight to the
/// Dock via `CoreDockSendNotification`. Device-side actions (`CycleDpiPresets`,
/// `SetDpiPreset`, `ToggleSmartShift`) have no CGEvent equivalent and are
/// handled at the hook/HID layer, logging a trace here.
///
/// On Linux, key and scroll events are injected via a lazily-created `uinput`
/// virtual device. Mouse clicks inject `BTN_*` events. macOS-only window
/// manager actions (`MissionControl`, `AppExpose`, `ShowDesktop`,
/// `LaunchpadShow`) have no universal Linux equivalent and are silently
/// skipped (debug-logged). `CustomShortcut` maps macOS `kVK_*` codes to
/// Linux key codes; macOS Cmd maps to Ctrl.
///
/// On Windows, key and mouse events are synthesised via `SendInput`. The
/// macOS window-manager actions map to their Windows equivalents (e.g.
/// `MissionControl` → Win+Tab, `ShowDesktop` → Win+D); `CustomShortcut`
/// maps macOS `kVK_*` codes to Windows virtual-key codes, with Cmd mapped to
/// Ctrl.
///
/// On other platforms a warning is logged and the function returns
/// immediately — the binary compiles clean on all targets.
///
/// # Manual verification
///
/// `execute` is intentionally excluded from the automated test suite because
/// it would need to intercept the OS event queue. Smoke-test it manually:
/// bind a button to any action in the GUI and confirm the expected system event
/// fires when the button is pressed (or use the `inject_action` example).
