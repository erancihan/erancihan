//! Restart the agent when its on-disk executable is replaced.
//!
//! An app update (Homebrew cask, the in-app updater, a dev rebuild) swaps the
//! bundle on disk while the old agent keeps running. launchd only restarts the
//! process when it *exits*, so nothing would pick up the new binary until the
//! next login — and a GUI launched from the new bundle refuses the old agent's
//! IPC protocol on a version bump, sitting on its connecting screen with no way
//! forward. Watching our own executable and replacing the process image once it
//! changes keeps "the running agent is the installed binary" true within a few
//! ticks, with no launchd or GUI involvement. On macOS the replacement is a
//! short delayed relaunch rather than an in-thread `exec`: the agent owns an
//! AppKit status item, and the new AppKit process must start from the normal
//! process main thread or the menu-bar item can render as an empty slot.
//!
//! Limitation: the path is resolved once via `current_exe`, which returns the
//! fully-resolved target (`/proc/self/exe` on Linux). Installs that update by
//! flipping a symlink to a new immutable payload (Nix profiles) never change
//! the resolved file, so this watcher can't see those updates; every shipped
//! channel replaces the binary in place.
