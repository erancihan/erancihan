//! Disk persistence for the immutable probe cache.
//!
//! A device's expensive probe result (model info, capabilities, feature
//! indexes) is immutable, so it only ever needs to be read once per device —
//! but the in-memory cache dies with the process, forcing every agent restart
//! to re-interview every device. Persisting the cache means a device that was
//! fully probed once keeps its identity across restarts, even on transports
//! where a fresh walk is slow or failing (see `BOLT_SLOT_PROBE`).
//!
//! Only Bolt identities are persisted, because only they are keyed on the
//! device's *own* identity (the pairing-register unit id), which no re-pairing
//! can silently reassign. A [`CacheKey::UnifyingSlot`] is `receiver + slot`: a
//! different device paired into that slot while the agent is down would
//! inherit the previous occupant's probe on warm start. A [`CacheKey::Direct`]
//! is an OS-runtime node id with no cross-boot stability. Loaded entries get
//! `probed_tick = 0`, so the regular [`super::cache::REFRESH_TICKS`]
//! self-healing pass re-walks them on schedule; until (and unless) that walk
//! succeeds, the persisted data serves exactly like an in-memory cache hit.
