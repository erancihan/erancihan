/// one [`Action`], or — for a raw-XY-capable button placed in gesture mode — a
/// per-[`GestureDirection`] map (hold + swipe up/down/left/right, or a plain
/// click).
///
/// There has only ever been one binding map per device; a gesture binding is
/// just a binding whose payload is a direction map instead of a single action.
///
/// # Serialization
///
/// `#[serde(untagged)]`: [`Single`](Binding::Single) serializes exactly as the
/// bare [`Action`] did before (a string `"BrowserBack"`, or a single-key table
/// for the payload variants), and [`Gesture`](Binding::Gesture) serializes as a
/// table keyed by [`GestureDirection`] names (`Up`/`Down`/`Left`/`Right`/
/// `Click`).
///
/// The two arms are disambiguated by the **zero overlap** between [`Action`]
/// variant names and [`GestureDirection`] variant names — untagged tries
/// `Single(Action)` first, and a table keyed by `Up` etc. cannot parse as an
/// externally-tagged `Action`, so it falls through to `Gesture`. A payload
/// action like `{ SetDpiPreset = 2 }` is a valid externally-tagged `Action`, so
/// it stays `Single` and never reaches the `Gesture` arm. This invariant is the
/// entire safety basis for untagged routing; the `binding_untagged_*` tests
/// guard it (a future `Action` named `Up`/`Down`/`Left`/`Right`/`Click` would
/// silently mis-route, and those tests would fail).
