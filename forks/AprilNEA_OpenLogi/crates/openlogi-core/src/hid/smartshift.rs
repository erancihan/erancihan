//! HID++ `SmartShift Enhanced` (feature `0x2111`) — wheel ratchet ↔
//! free-spin control with sensitivity threshold.
//!
//! The protocol-level `0x2111` wrapper lives in `openlogi-hidpp`; this module
//! keeps OpenLogi's IPC/config-facing mode and status types.
//!
//! Mode encoding (consistent across 0x2110 / 0x2111):
//! - `wheelMode` `1` = free-spin (no ratchet, infinite scroll), `2` =
//!   ratchet (clicky).
//! - `autoDisengage` `0x01`–`0xFE` = the wheel speed (in 0.25 turn/s steps)
//!   past which a ratchet-mode wheel releases into free-spin — i.e. the
//!   "SmartShift" threshold. `0xFF` keeps the ratchet engaged permanently
//!   (never auto-switches). See [`AUTO_DISENGAGE_PERMANENT`].
